# Harmony-Tools

A collection of tools which can be used to translate Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony video game. Currently, only the PC version of this game is supported.

## Usage

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/redssu/Harmony-Tools/wiki) pages of this repository - there are several articles and guides to help you get started translating V3.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. I just started programming in C#, so in the code of tools there are definitely things that can be done better, more efficiently.


## Notes

Most of these tools are basically wrappers to tools made by [CapitanSwag](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101) - he did most of the hard work - these tools would not be created without his effort. My goal was to create a translator-friendly set of tools, so I used code of [DRV3-Sharp](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101/DRV3-Sharp) and made them completely non-interactive and then I made a context menu for them. 

The repository created by [EDDxample](https://github.com/EDDxample) ([Ultimate-DRv3-Toolset](https://github.com/EDDxample/ultimate-drv3-toolset)) was also a huge source of informations for me. Without it, I couldn't write a font packing tool.

I'd also like to thank @Paks for the effort he put in finding bugs in the tools. Many of them wouldn't have been detected without his help.
