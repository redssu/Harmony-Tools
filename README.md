This tool is mostly just a user-friendly interface for the V3Lib library created by [CaptainSwag101](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101). Without his hard work, Harmony-Tools wouldn't exist at all. CaptainSwag101 is also developing his own version of tools for working with Danganronpa V3 - [DRV3-Sharp](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101/DRV3-Sharp).

The [Ultimate-DRv3-Toolset](https://github.com/EDDxample/ultimate-drv3-toolset) repository created by [EDDxample](https://github.com/EDDxample) was a mine of knowledge for me when it comes to font files.

I would also like to thank [Paks](https://github.com/P4K5) for the effort he put into finding errors/bugs and testing the tools. Without him, most of them would probably have escaped my notice.
